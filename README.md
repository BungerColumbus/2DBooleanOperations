# 2DBooleanOperations
My attempt at 2D boolean operations in unity.

In here you can find various exercises which will eventually lead to an entire script of 2D boolean operations.

I intend to explain the script and the way they work as good as possible

(version control doesn't look too good, but I fixed it later.
I realised I shouldn't have worked directly on the main branch,
but instead create a specific branch to work on and after a push,
merge that branch with the main one... sorry about that one.)
